= Save Project

One difference users may encounter in OpenSCD compared to a desktop application is the handling of *saving projects*. 
Since OpenSCD operates within a browser environment, saving files follows the standard behavior of the browser. 
Typically, this means that files are automatically downloaded to the user's default download folder on their machine.

However, users have the option to customize this behavior. 
For instance, in Chrome and Chromium browsers, this setting can be adjusted by enabling the option labeled *Ask where to save each file before downloading*.
