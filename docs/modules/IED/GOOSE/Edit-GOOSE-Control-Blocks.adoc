The configuration of GOOSEs, or more precisely, GOOSE Blocks, is done on the SCL element `GSEControl`, its referenced `DataSet` element, and its referenced `GSE` element allocated in the `Communication` section. The schema restricts the allocation of the element:

. `GSEControl` must reside in the `LN0` element.
. `GSEControl` and its referenced `DataSet` must have the same parent.

*Editing GOOSEs*

In OpenSCD, `GSEControl` elements are configured using so-called wizards. There are three wizards combined that allow editing of GOOSE.

&nbsp;

The wizard contains a set of setting allocated in the `GSEControl` element:

* `name`: The main identifier for the GOOSE within the SCL. It must be unique for all `GSEControl` elements in the same parent element and influences the GOOSE Control Block reference.
* `desc`: An optional string describing the `GSEControl` element.
* `type`: Indicates whether this control block is a `GOOSE` or `GSSE` type. The later one is deprecated!
* `appID`: A unique identifier for the GOOSE.
* `fixedOffs`: Allows specifying the type of encoding for the GOOSE. Refer to IEC 61850-8-1 for more information.
* `securityEnabled`: Specifies the type of security measures the GOOSE has: encryption and/or signature, or none of the two.

To modify any of these attributes, click on the *Save* button within the wizard.

*Communication page*

This page allows you to do define all communication-related setting for the GOOSE. This information is then saved to the `Communication` section.

. `MAC-Address`: Specifies the destination MAC address of the GOOSE.
. `APPID`: The APPID of the GOOSE. This is recommended to be unique throughout the entire project.
. `VLAN-ID`: Determines the virtual LAN ID to wich the GOOSE shall be limited.
. `VLAN-PRIORITY`: The priority of the GOOSE message. Can be used to priories time-critical messages like trip signals over non-time-critical messages.
. `MinTime`: The minimum time between two occurring GOOSEs when, for example, a trip occurs.
. `MaxTime`: The maximum time between two occurring GOOSEs in case there is not trip.

Each wizard represents one element in the SCL. To navigate between them, click on the *more vert* icon button on the upper-left corner. The pop-up menu will display various choices.

. Remove the `GSEControl` element
+
NOTE: If the referenced `DataSet` element is exclusively linked to this GOOSE, it will also be removed.

. Open the data set wizard for the `DataSet` referenced by this GOOSE.
. Open the communication wizard.
