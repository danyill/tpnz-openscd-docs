The Sampled Value service is designed to transmit current and voltage measurement data via Ethernet, as defined in 9-2. While there is an alternative way using other connection mechanisms, as outlined in IEC 61850-9-1, this method is neither described nor supported in OpenSCD.

Sampled Value Streams utilize a multicast mechanism instead of TCP/IP to send to all communication participants in the same LAN/VLAN. The sending (publishing) and usage (subscription) of Sampled Value Streams are therefore completely separated. This has implications for the configuration of Sampled Value-related communication in the SCL.

*Publishing: Sampled Value Control Block (SampledValueControl)*

The configuration of Sampled Value publishers is done in the SCL element `SampledValueControl` and its referenced `DataSet` element. The reference to its `DataSet` is set through the `datSet` attribute in the `SampledValueControl` element.

NOTE: `SampledValueControl` must reside in the `LN0` element, and both `SampledValueControl` and its referenced `DataSet` must share the same parent.

Configuring the publisher involves three basics steps:

. Create control block: Create the element `SampledValueControl` or import SCL with pre-existing `SampledValueControl` elements.
. Create data set: Create element `DataSet` in the same parent as the `SampledValueControl` and add data `FCDA` to it.
. Combine control block and data set: Set the `datSet` attribute within the `SampledValueControl` element.
