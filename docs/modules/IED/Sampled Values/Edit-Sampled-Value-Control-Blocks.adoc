The configuration of Sampled Values, or more precisely Sampled Value Blocks, is done on the SCL element `SampledValueControl`, its referenced `DataSet` element, and its referenced `SMV` element allocated in the `Communication` section. The schema restricts the allocation of the element in the following way:

. `SampledValueControl` must reside in the `LN0` element.
. `SampledValueControl` and its referenced `DataSet` must have the same parent.
. `SMV` can only exist if the access point (`ConnectedAP`) of the server is connected to a sub-network (`SubNetwork`) in the `Communication` section.

*Editing Sampled Values*

In OpenSCD, `SampledValueControl` elements are configured using so-called wizards. There are three wizards combined that allow the editing of Sampled Value Control Blocks.

&nbsp;

The wizard contains a set of settings allocated in the element `SampledValueControl`:

* `name`: The main identifier for the Sampled Value within the SCL. It must be unique for all `SampledValueControl` elements in the same parent element and influences the Sampled Value Control Block reference.
* `desc`: An optional string describing the `SampledValueControl` element.
* `multicast`: Only visible when false, as non-multicast sampled value streams are deprecated.
* `smvID`: A unique identifier for the Sampled Value.
* `smpMod`: The mode in which the sample rate is expressed. Options include Samples per period, sampled per second, or Seconds per sampled. The default is Samples per period
* `smpRate`: The sample rate, dependent on the sample mode.
* `noASDU`: Timestamps per Ethernet packet.
* `securityEnabled`: Specifies the type of security measures the Sampled Value has: encryption and/or signature, or none of the two.

To change any of the attributes, click on the *Save* button within the wizard.

*Editing the Optional information page*

This wizard enables the configuration of optional behaviors for the sampled value stream.

. `refreshTime`: Specifies whether the timestamp of the generation of the sample value stream shall be included.
. `sampleRate`: Determines whether the sample rate and sample mode shall be part of the sampled value stream.
. `dataSet`: Specifies whether the data set reference shall be part of the sampled value stream.
. `security`: Determines whether the sampled value stream contains the security attribute (Used for future definitions such as digital signature).
. `synchSourceId`: Specifies whether the the sampled value stream contains the synchronizing grand master ID.

*Communication page*

This wizard allows you to define all communication-related settings for the Sampled Value. This information is saved in the `Communication` section, more precisely in the element `SMV`.

. `MAC-Address`: Specifies the destination MAC address of the Sampled Value, ranging from `01-0C-CD-04-00-00` to `01-0C-CD-04-01-FF`.
. `APPID`: Sets the APPID of the Sampled Value, and it is recommended to be unique throughout the entire project.
. `VLAN-ID`: Determines the virtual LAN ID to which the Sampled Value shall be limited.
. `VLAN-PRIORITY`: Sets the priority of the Sampled Value message, allowing prioritization of time-critical messages like trip signals over non-time-critical messages.

*Navigating between wizard*

Each wizard represents one element in the SCL. To navigate between them, click on the *more vert* icon button in the upper-left corner. The pop-up menu display various choices.

. Remove the `SampledValueControl` element. If its referenced data set is exclusively linked to this control block, it will be removed as well.
. Open the data set wizard for the `DataSet` referenced by this Sampled Value.
. Open the communication wizard.
