A `ClientLN` is one of the three elements that describe connections between IEDs in a SCL file.

*HowTo connect Report with ClientLNs*

OpenSCD allows you to connect `ReportControl` via `ClientLN`. The starting point is the *IED* in the *Substation* editor.

* Click on an *IED*.
* Click on the *Add connection* button.
* The `ClientLN` wizard opens.
* On the left-hand side, you can select the `ReportControl` element(s) in the project.
* On the right-hand side, you can see all logical nodes in the receiving IED (client).
* All so-called client logical nodes - logical nodes allocated to `AccessPoint` are sorted to be on top.
* `LN0` elements are sorted to be at the bottom.
* Click on `CONNECT`.

NOTE: If `ClientLN` connections are already present in the `Report Control` block, the wizard does not close on *CONNECT*

NOTE: If the `RptEnabled` `max` attribute is smaller or equal to the `ClientLN`, a connection is not possible. The `ReportControl` on the right-hand side is disabled.

TIP: You can filter for several terms at the same time. The space between terms acts as a logical AND.
