The Report is a service defined in the IEC 61850-7-2 standard. It facilitates event-driven communication by incorporating trigger options into the Report, enabling the server to generate a report and transmit it to the client based on events occurring in the substation. This service is commonly applied for communication between bay-level equipment and station-level equipment and is utilized for signals such as:

. Measurement information
. Status of switchgear and other sensors in the substation

*Report Control Block*

The configuration of Reports, specifically Report Control Blocks, is managed through the SCL element `ReportControl` and its associated child elements: `TrgOpts` (trigger options), `OptFields` (optional fields), and `RptEnabled` (containing the clients) and its referenced `DataSet` element. Additionally, it references a `DataSet` element using the `datSet` attribute within the `ReportControl` element.

NOTE: The `ReportControl` element must reside within the `LN0` or `LN` element, and both the `ReportControl` and its referenced `DataSet` must share the same parent element.

*Dynamic vs. Static Reporting*

Configuring reports involves three steps, which can be executed either dynamically or statically, depending on the chosen strategy. Dynamic configuration occurs online, while static configuration takes place in a system configuration tool (SCT) or an IED configuration tool (ICT).

|===
| basic step  |  static reporting | dynamic reporting

| create control block
| Both SCT or ICT but more common in SCT
| Predefined empty Report control blocks in the *.icd file

| create data set
| Both SCT or ICT but more common in SCT
| Online using `CreateDataSet` request defined in IEC 61850-7-2

| combine control block and data set
| Both SCT and ICT but more common in SCT
| Online using `SetBRCBValues`, `SetURCBValues`

| Enable the Report by a client
| Online using `SetBRCBValues`, `SetURCBValues` request. Can be automated using the `ClientLN` element in the SCL file
| Online using `SetBRCBValues`, `SetURCBValues` request. Can be automated using the `ClientLN` element in the SCL file but not common for dynamic reports
