= Merge or Diff

Merge is a fundamental functionality that enables the importation of information from other files or the updating of existing elements with information from other files.

To understand what *OpenSCD* is doing behind the scenes, we need to explain two terms first:

. Same: Two elements are considered the same if they share identical identities.
In the context of OpenSCD, the identity of all elements is defined based on a set of unique attributes within the element's hierarchy.
For instance, a `Bay` element must possess a `name` attribute that is unique within the `VoltageLevel` according to the standard.
This is the id for this element.
The same is true vor all parent elements until the `SCL` tag.
The identity of a "Bay" element, therefore, comprises all `name` attributes separated by `>` symbols, such as `AA1>E1>Q01`. Other elements may have different identifiers, like the `id` attribute of the `LNodeType` element.
In some cases, the index is utilized to construct the identity.
. Equal: Two elements are equal if they and all their children are identical, and their attributes match.

The merge functionality utilizes these two attributes of elements to determine differences and facilitates merging elements from different files.

To utilize this functionality, you can click on *Merge Project* or *Update Substation*.

. Edit: Attributes same - element's - imported and existing - are present but differ.
For example, in the existing element, it is named _Bay01_, while in the imported one, it is named _Bay Q01_.
. Add: An attribute or a child element is present in the imported file but not in the existing file.
. Delete: An attribute is present in the existing but not in the imported same element or a same child element is present in the existing but not in the imported file.
For example, the attribute _sxy:x_ exists in the existing file but not in the imported one.
. Merge: The elements in both the existing and imported files are the same but differ in attributes and/or child elements.

The merge process is a step-by-step procedure that begins with the root element `SCL`, then progresses through all its child elements.
This means that you will encounter a wizard page for each child element that is not the same.
Once these differences are addressed, the process moves on to the child elements of the selected element.

As an example let's assume you imported a file that differs in one `DO` definition within a `LNodeType` - `desc`, a `LN` definition with one of four `IED` elements and within one of three `Bay` elements within a `Substation` - here `desc` again is different.

. The merge process begins with the `SCL` element, indicating that three elements are not equal and can be merged: `Substation`, one `IED`, and the `DataTypeTemplates`. Suppose you choose to merge only the `Substation` and the `DataTypeTemplates`, leaving out the `IED`.
. The next wizard page displays the `Substation` element, indicating that the `VoltageLevel` is not equal and can be merged.
Let's assume there is only one `VoltageLevel`, so you select it.
. The subsequent step presents the `DataTypeTemplates` element, indicating that one `LNodeType` is not equal, and you opt to merge it.
. Following that, the `Bay` element is presented.
Here, the `desc` attribute differs, and you have the option to edit it.
No child elements are shown as they are identical.
. Next, the `LNodeType` element is displayed, revealing the one `DO` child element that is not equal.
. Lastly, the `DO` element differs in the `desc` attribute, allowing you to decide whether to edit it.

== Update Substation

The distinction between *Merge Project* and *Update Substation* lies in the fact that the latter specifically targets the `Substation` element, and the process is automated.
To streamline the user experience and reduce complexity, we have simplified the options.
Specifically, the selection is predefined to be:

. Edit: selected
. Add: selected
. Delete: de-selected
. Merge: selected

To ensure the production of valid files and prevent inadvertent invalidations, elements of `LNode` are checked before editing or adding to ensure their uniqueness within the `Substation` element.
Additionally, they are required to reference an existing `LN` or `LN0` within the project.
For instance, if the imported project contains an `LNode` that references a logical node not present in the existing project, the `LNode` element is ignored.
