In *OpenSCD*, elements are manipulated using wizard pages.
If a page hasn't been created for a specific element you wish to manipulate, or if you're simply curious about how the element appears in XML, we've incorporated a *pro mode* that you can activate in the *Settings*.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

. Open *Menu*
. Click on *Setting*
. Click on switch *pro mode*

Once this is completed, you can open any wizard page, such as *Edit Substation*. On the upper right corner, you'll find a toggle button.
Clicking this button makes the wizard page disappear, revealing the XML code editor containing the raw XML representation of the element.

NOTE: This feature is designed for experienced users.
It allows you to modify SCL content, effectively replacing the element entirely with the updated version behind the scenes.
Rest assured, you have the flexibility to undo any changes at any time.
