In this section, you will be guided through the process of creating one valid `LNodeType`. We will focus on the logical node class `CSWI`.

Before delving into the details, let's conduct a small experiment:

. Open *OpenSCD*.
. Create a new Edition 2.1 project.
. Navigate to the *Template editor*.
. Add a `DataTypeTemplate`.
. Click on *Add LNodeType*.
. Click on *Value*.
. Select an empty logical node class, for example, _CSWI_, as the *lnClass*.
. Click on *Next...*.
. Click on *Save*.

The wizard does not allow you to save it because you have not defined the minimum required data objects, which are highlighted in red. When you try to add something here, you are disappointed again, as the list is empty. This is because *OpenSCD* tries to find a `DOType` that fits the definition of the `DO` but cannot find any because there are no ``DOType``s yet in the project.

In this case, for example, you need to have one `DOType` of the type `ENS`. Additionally, the data object `Pos` is required, which is of type `DPC`.

Let's start with `Beh` first. This is of the common data class (CDC) `ENS`. If you look into the IEC 61850 7-3 standard and find the `ENS` table, you will see that you need at least `stVal`, `q`, and `t`. So let's create the `DOType` first.

. Click on *Add DOType*.
. Leave *value* empty.
. Type _BehENS_ into the *id* field.

OpenSCD adds this `DOType`, but the validator indicates that it is not valid, so don't stop here. Let's add the ``DA``s `q` and `t` first.

. Click on *BehENS*.
. Click on *Add Data Attribute*.
. Type in _q_ into the *name* field.
. Select _Quality_ in the *bType* field.
. Type in _ST_ in the *fc* field (functional constraint).
. Click *Save*.
. Click on *BehENS* again.
. Click on *Add Data Attribute*.
. Type in _t_ into the *name* field.
. Select _Timestamp_ in the *bType* field.
. Type in _ST_ in the *fc* field (functional constraint).
. Click *Save*.

Where do I get this information? You might ask: You have to look into the IEC 61850 7-3 table for `ENS`.

The next attribute, `stVal`, is a bit more tricky. If you look into the same table, you will see that the `bType` attribute is Enum and is also defined in the IEC 61850 7-3 standard. This Enum is called `BehaviorModeKind`. Here, you can decide to either create it from scratch again. However, with Enums, we do not recommend it as all Enums are clearly defined and are part of the templates. So, let's take the one from the templates:

. Click on *Add EnumType*.
. Select _BehaviorModeKind_ as the *Value*.
. Type in _OpenSCD_BehaviorModeKind_ into the *id* field.
. Click *Save*.

Now we can proceed to add the data attribute `stVal`.

. Click on *BehENS* once again.
. Click on *Add Data Attribute*.
. Type in _stVal_ into the *name* field.
. Select _Enum_ in the *bType* field.
. The *type* field is enabled and shows all ``EnumType``s in the project.
. Select _OpenSCD_BehaviorModeKind_ in the *type* field.
. Click *Save*.

Still, the validator will complain because the `cdc` attribute is empty but required within our `DOType`.

. Click on *BehENS* as before.
. Type in _ENS_ into the *cdc* field.
. Click *Save*.

Now we're nearly done. We just need to define a `DOType`, which must be of a `DPC` common data class. To reduce complexity, you can create a https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Create-status-only-DPC[status-only DPC type]. For the full experience, you can create a https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Create-sbw-with-enchanced-security-DPC[sbo-with-enhanced-security DPC]

Finally, we are at a stage to create the `LNodeType` with `lnClass` `CSWI`.

. Click on *Add LNodeType*.
. Select an empty logical node class, e.g., _CSWI_, as the *lnClass*.
. Don't forget the *id* field.
. Click on *Next...*.
. For the required data objects `Beh` and `Pos`, the wizard suggests the two ``DOType``s you just created.

And there you have it! This procedure is basically always the same but with different kinds of common data classes that you need to create before being able to create an `LNodeType`.

NOTE: In the *Select Data Objects* wizard, OpenSCD suggests ``DOType``s based on their `cdc` definition. It does not check if the `DOType` has the correct structure.
