You can utilize OpenSCD to incorporate new ``DO``'s instances into an existing `LNodeType`. Follow these steps:

. Navigate to the desired `LNodeType` you wish to modify and open the *Edit LNodeType* wizard.
. Click on the *DATA OBJECT* button located in the middle of the wizard interface.

_Settings_:

. *name**: When selecting a `DO` from the IEC&#8239;61850 namespace, consult IEC&#8239;61850&#x2011;7&#x2011;4. Otherwise, ensure that the name starts with an uppercase letter [A-Z].
. *desc*: This field allows users to provide a user-defined description.
. *type**: The type is specified as a string in the SCL but presented as a selector in OpenSCD. The selector displays all `DOType` - `id` available in the project. A `DO` cannot be created without an existing `DOType`.
. *accessControl*: A user-defined string used to describe access control permissions.
. *transient*: If the `DO` is from the IEC&#8239;61850 namespace, the transient attribute must adhere to the specifications outlined in IEC&#8239;61850&#x2011;7&#x2011;4. For example, `Tr` is used for the logical node class `PTRC`.

____
*CHECKS*: The schema validator covers missing or incorrect `name` attributes, while the template validator handles missing or incorrect `type` attributes.

*Edit DO*

You can utilize OpenSCD to modify existing `DO` elements. Follow these steps:

. Navigate to the list of ``LNodeType``s in the *template editor*.
. Select the `LNodeType` containing the desired `DO` you wish to edit.
. Click on the specific `DO` you wish to modify to open the *Edit DO* wizard.

&nbsp;

_Settings_:

The settings available in the *Edit DO* wizard are the same as those in the *Add DO* wizard, with the addition of a remove button for removing the selected `DO`.

_Example:_

----
<DO name="Mod" type="OpenSCD_ENCMod">
----

&nbsp;

*Remove DO*

To remove a DO from an existing LNodeType, follow these steps:

. Open the *Edit DO* wizard by navigating to the LNodeType list in the template editor and clicking on the LNodeType that contains the DO you want to remove.
. Within the Edit DO wizard, click on the *Remove* button.

____
*WARNING*: Be cautious when removing DOs, as OpenSCD does not perform validity checks before removal.
