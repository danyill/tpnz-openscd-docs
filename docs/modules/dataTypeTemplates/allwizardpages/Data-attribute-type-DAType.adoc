. Navigate to the list of ``DAType``'s in the *Template editor*.
. Click on *Add DAType*.
. Select either a `DAType` from the template library or leave the *value* field empty for a new one.

_Settings_:

* *id**: Ensure that the ID is unique within the entire project.
* *desc*: User-defined description field.

_From IEC 61850_

OpenSCD templates contain all data attribute types from IEC 61850-7-3. Unlike `EnumType`, most pre-defined ``DAType``s offer more flexibility in their definition. For example, you can examine the definition of the `AnalogueValue` as specified in the link:[NSD] files.

----
<ConstructedAttribute name="AnalogueValue"
    titleID="IEC61850_7_3.AnalogueValue::AnalogueValue.cl.title">
    <SubDataAttribute name="i"
        type="INT32"
        ...
        presCond="AtLeastOne"
        presCondArgs="1"/>
    <SubDataAttribute name="f"
        type="FLOAT32"
        ...
        presCond="AtLeastOne"
        presCondArgs="1"/>
</ConstructedAttribute>
----

The definition, especially the attribute `presCond`, provides the flexibility to decide whether one or both can be children of the `AnalogueValue`. This means that as a user, you must determine the structure of your `AnalogueValue`. In OpenSCD templates, most ``DAType``s include all possible children by default. You can then remove unnecessary children to customize the `DAType` according to your requirements.

NOTE: ``DAType``s in the OpenSCD templates often include all possible children. Please verify if you truly need all of them. Refer to the standard's `DAType` definition for clarification.

_User-defined_

An empty `DAType` is added to the project, which is often invalid in many cases, so do not consider the process complete at this stage.

. Navigate to the list of ``DAType``s in the *template editor*.
. Click on the `DAType` you wish to edit.

_Settings_:

. *id**: Ensure that the ID is unique across the entire project.
. *desc*: User-defined description field.
. List of all child `BDA`: This section displays the ID and type (`bType`) of each child `BDA`. If the type starts with *#*, it indicates that the `BDA` is either a constructed attribute or an enumeration.

_Example_:

----
<DAType id="OpenSCD_Originator">
    <BDA name="orCat" bType="Enum" type="OriginatorCategoryKind"/>
    <BDA name="orIdent" bType="Octet64"/>
</DAType>
