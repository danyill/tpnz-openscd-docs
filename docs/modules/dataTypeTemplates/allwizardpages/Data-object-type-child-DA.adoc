You can utilize OpenSCD to add new ``DA``s to an existing `DOType`. Here's how:

. Navigate to the `DOType` you want to edit and open the *Edit DOType* wizard.
. Click on the *DATA ATTRIBUTE* button in the middle of the wizard.

_Settings_:

. *name**: If you intend to include a `BDA` from the IEC 61850 namespace, refer to the guidelines provided in the IEC 61850-7-4 standard. Alternatively, if you are creating a custom BDA, ensure that its name begins with a lowercase letter (a-z).
. *desc*: A user-defined description field for additional information about the attribute.
. *bType*_: The basic type of the attribute. If it is an *Enum_ or _Struct_, the *type* field must not be empty.
. *type*_: While the type is defined as a string in the SCL, in OpenSCD, it is presented as a selector. If *bType* is *Struct_, the selector displays all `DAType` - ``id``'s available in the project. However, it's important to note that without existing `DAType` in the project, you cannot create a `BDA`. Conversely, if *bType* is _Enum_, the selector showcases all `EnumType` - ``id``'s present in the project.
. *sAddr*: User-defined string to describe a short address for the attribute.
. *valKind*: This attribute may be absent, and if present, it must be either set to true or false.
. *valImport*: This attribute may be absent, and if present, it must be either set to true or false.
. *Val*: Allows you to pre-define the value offline. This can be added to any data attribute (`DA` or `BDA`).
. *dchg*: Specifies data change according to IEC 61850-7-3 for this particular data attribute.
. *qchg*: Specifies quality change. It is true for all `DA` with the name _a_, otherwise, it is empty.
. *dupd*: Specifies data update according to IEC 61850-7-3 for this particular data attribute.
. *fc*: Specifies the functional constraint according to IEC 61850-7-3 for this particular data attribute.

NOTE: The definition of `Val` may not be relevant for all functional constraints (`FC`). For instance, defining a value for a status-type data attribute like `stVal` may not be meaningful. However, for other data attributes, pre-defining the value can be beneficial, such as for `ctlModel`.

NOTE: Starting from Edition 2, you cannot create custom common data classes (CDC) and must use predefined CDCs from IEC 61850-7-3 for user-defined data objects. Therefore, the data attributes are already defined. Please refer to the relevant tables to set the attributes `dchg`, `qchg`, `dupd`, and `fc`.

*Edit DA*

You can use OpenSCD to modify existing `DA` elements. Here's how:

. Navigate to the list of `DOType` in the *Template Editor*.
. Select the `DOType` that contains the `DA` you want to modify.
. Click on the specific child `DA` you wish to edit.

_Settings_:

The settings are similar to those in the *Add DA* wizard, with the addition of a remove button for deletion.

_Example:_

----
<DA name="ctlModel" bType="Enum" fc="CF" type="CtlModelKind">
    <Val>sbo-with-enhanced-security</Val>
</DA>
----

&nbsp;

*Remove DA*

To delete a `DA`:

. Open the *Edit DA* wizard.
. Click on the *Remove* button.

____
*WARNING:* Be cautious when removing elements, as OpenSCD does not verify the action's validity before execution.
