To add new ``BDA``s to an existing `DAType` using OpenSCD, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the `DAType` you wish to edit and open the *Edit DAType* wizard.
. Click on the *DATA ATTRIBUTE* button located in the middle of the wizard.

_Settings_:

. *name**: If you intend to include a `BDA` from the IEC 61850 namespace, refer to the guidelines provided in the IEC 61850-7-4 standard. Alternatively, if you are creating a custom `BDA`, ensure that its name begins with a lowercase letter (a-z).
. *desc*: Provide a user-defined description for the attribute.
. *bType*_: Select the basic type of the attribute. If *Enum_ or _Struct_ is chosen, the *type* field must not be left empty.
. *type*_: Type is defined as a string in the SCL but is a selector in OpenSCD. If the *bType* is set to *Struct_, the selector displays all `DAType` - ``id``'s in the project. Note that without existing `DAType` in the project, you cannot create a `BDA` with a Struct type. Conversely, if the *bType* is *Enum*, the selector displays all `EnumType` - ``id``'s in the project.
. *sAddr*: This is a user-defined string used to describe a short address for the attribute.
. *valKind*: This field may be optional. If present, it must be set to either true or false.
. *valImport*: Specify whether the value should be imported.
. *Val*: This field allows you to pre-define the value offline for the attribute. It can be added to any data attribute (`DA` or `BDA`).

____
*NOTE:* The `Val` definition may not be relevant for all function constraints (`FC`). For example, defining a value for a status-type data attribute like `stVal` may not be very useful. However, for other data attributes, such as `ctlModel`, pre-defining the value can be quite meaningful.
____

____
*CHECKS:* The schema validator covers missing or incorrect `name` attributes, while the template validator addresses missing or incorrect `type` attributes.

*Edit BDA*

You can use OpenSCD to modify existing `BDA` elements. Here's how:

. Navigate to the list of `DAType` in the *Template editor*.
. Click on the `DAType` that contains the `BDA` you want to edit.
. Click on the child `BDA` you wish to modify.

_Settings_:

The settings are the same as those in the *Add BDA* wizard, with the addition of a remove button for deletion.

_Example:_

----
<BDA name="orCat" bType="Enum" type="OpenSCD_OriginatorCategoryKind">
----

&nbsp;

*Remove BDA*

To delete a `BDA` from a `DAType`, follow these steps:

. Open the *Edit DAType* wizard.
. Click on the `BDA` you want to remove.
. Click on the *Remove* button.

____
*WARNING*: Be cautious when removing ``BDA``s as OpenSCD does not perform validity checks before deletion.
