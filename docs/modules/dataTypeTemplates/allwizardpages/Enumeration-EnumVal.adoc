. Navigate to the `EnumType` to which you want to add an `EnumVal`, then open the *Edit EnumType* wizard.
. Click on the *ENUM VALUE* button located within the wizard.

_Settings_:

. *ord**: This attribute must be unique within the EnumType.
. *desc*: User-defined description field.
. *value**: The enumeration value specified as a string.

*Edit EnumVal*

To modify an existing `EnumVal` element, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the `EnumType` that contains the `EnumVal` you want to edit.
. Open the *Edit EnumType* page and click on the `EnumVal` you want to edit to access the *Edit Enum* wizard.

_Settings_:

. *ord**: This attribute must be unique within the `EnumType`.
. *desc*: User-defined description field.
. *value**: The enumeration value specified as a string.

_Example:_

----
<EnumVal ord="1">on</EnumVal>
----

*Remove EnumVal*

Removing `EnumVal` from an `EnumType` may be necessary at times to align with vendor-specific data models. For instance, in the `BehaviorModeKind` enumeration, it is common to include only "on," "test," and "off" values, omitting "test/blocked" and "on-blocked" options.

. Open the `EnumVal` you want to remove in the *Edit EnumVal* wizard.
. Click on the *Remove* button.
