You can utilize OpenSCD to include new ``SDO``s within an existing `DOType`. Follow these steps:

. Navigate to the `DOType` you wish to modify and open the *Edit DOType* wizard.
. Click on the *DATA OBJECT* button located in the middle of the wizard.

_Settings_:

. *name**: When selecting a `SDO` from the IEC 61850 namespace, refer to IEC 61850‑7‑4. Otherwise, ensure that the name begins with an uppercase letter [A-Z].
. *desc*: This field allows for user-defined descriptions.
. *type**: While the type is defined as a string in the SCL, it appears as a selector in OpenSCD. The selector displays all `DOType` - ``id``'s available in the project. Without existing ``DOType``s, you cannot create a `DO`.

____
*CHECKS*: The schema validator handles cases of missing or incorrect `name`, while the template validator addresses issues related to missing or incorrect `type`.

*Edit DO*

You can utilize OpenSCD to modify existing `DO` elements. Follow these steps:

. Navigate to the list of ``DOType``s in the *template editor*.
. Select the `DOType` that includes the `SDO`. For example, choose the common data class `WYE`.
. Click on the specific child `SDO` you wish to modify to open the *Edit SDO* wizard.

&nbsp;

_Settings_:

The settings available are identical to those in the *Add SDO* wizard, with the additional option to remove the selected `SDO`.

_Example:_

----
<SDO  name="res" type="ABBIED600_Rev5_CMV_1"/>
----

&nbsp;

*Remove SDO*

To remove a SDO from a DOType, follow these steps:

. Open the *Edit SDO* wizard.
. Click on the *Remove* button.

____
*WARNING*: Exercise caution when removing SDOs, as OpenSCD does not perform validity checks before deletion.
