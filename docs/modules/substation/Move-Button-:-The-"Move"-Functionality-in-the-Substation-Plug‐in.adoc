The "Move" button within the Substation plug-in facilitates the relocation of Substation, Voltage Level, and Bay blocks within the OpenSCD workspace. Users can use this button to shift blocks from left to right and vice versa.

For example, consider the image below, showcasing one Substation with a single Voltage Level and multiple Bay blocks. This document provides an explanation of how this function operates within the Substation plug-in.

To move the Q01-Bay block next to the BusBar A block, users should click the Move button of the Q01-Bay block, then select BusBar A. Subsequently, the Q01-Bay block will be positioned to the left of BusBar A. Refer to the images below for a visual representation of these changes.

Another example involves moving the BusBar B. To shift BusBar B to the left side of the blocks, users click the Move button of the BusBar B block and then select the BayA-FieldA block. As shown below, the BusBar B block is moved to the left side of the chosen block (BayA-FieldA).

It's essential to note that the block to be moved always positions itself to the left side of the selected block.
