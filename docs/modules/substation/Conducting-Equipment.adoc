To create a new `ConductingEquipment` element within the parent `Bay`:

* Navigate to the *Substation* editor.
* Select the parent *Bay* to which you want to add the conducting equipment.
* Choose the appropriate type for the conducting equipment.
* Fill in all the required values.
* Click on the *Add* button.

The create wizard allows you to set:

* `type`: Choose from a set of predefined types as per the IEC 61850 standard.
* `name`: Unique identifier of the conducting equipment within the parent `Bay`.
* `desc`: Human-readable description of the conducting equipment.

*Edit ConductingEquipment*

To edit a `ConductingEquipment` element:

* Navigate to the *Substation* editor.
* Choose the specific *ConductingEquipment* you wish to modify.
* Click on the *edit* button.
* Apply the desired changes, then click *Save*.

The `ConductingEquipment` element has two attributes:

* `name`: a unique identifier of the Bay in the parent `Bay`.
* `desc`: a human-readable description.
* `type`: cannot be edited!

*Remove ConductingEquipment*

To remove an existing `ConductingEquipment` element within the parent `Bay`:

* Navigate to the *Substation* editor.
* Select the *ConductingEquipment* you wish to remove.
* Click on the *delete* button.

NOTE: OpenSCD does not support the definition of user-defined conducting equipment types. This can only be manipulated through the code editor.
NOTE: The *Earth Switch* is unfortunately not a type but a special version of `DIS`. It can be tagged to an earth switch through the data object `SwType` (a logical node reference to the logical node of class `XSWI`) that must be present. Alternatively, it has a child `Terminal` with a `cNodeName = grounded`. Both of these cases are recognized by OpenSCD and displayed. When you create a new *Earth Switch*, the second option is applied.
