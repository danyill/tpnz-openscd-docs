To create a new `VoltageLevel` element within a `Substation` element, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the *Substation* editor
* Select the *Substation* where you intend to add the voltage level.
* Click on the *Add mode* button located in the upper right corner of the *Substation* pane.
* Complete all required fields.
* Click on the *Add* button.

The creation wizard allows you to configure the following parameters:

* `name`: a unique identifier for the voltage level within the parent substation.
* `desc`: a human-readable description.
* `nomFreq`: the nominal frequency of the voltage level (e.g. 50Hz/60Hz/16.6Hz).
* `numPhases`: the number of phases.
* `Voltage`: the voltage of the voltage level (combination of value and multiplier).

*Edit Voltage Level*

To edit a `VoltageLevel` element, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the *Substation* editor.
* Select the *VoltageLevel* you wish to edit.
* Click on the *edit* button.
* Make the necessary changes and click *Save*.

The `VoltageLevel` element has four attributes:

* `name`: a unique identifier for the voltage level within the parent substation.
* `desc`: a human-readable description.
* `nomFreq`: the nominal frequency of the voltage level (e.g. 50Hz/60Hz/16.6Hz).
* `numPhases`: the number of phases.

The *Voltage* setting is used to edit the `Voltage` element, which is structured as follows:

[,xml]
----
<Voltage multiplier="k" unit="V">110</Voltage>
----

In the wizard, you have the option to set the `multiplier` and the value (110), with the unit fixed to `V`.

*Remove Voltage Level*

To remove an existing `VoltageLevel` element within the parent `Substation`

* Navigate to the *Substation* editor.
* Select the *Voltage Level* you wish to remove.
* Click on the *delete* button.
