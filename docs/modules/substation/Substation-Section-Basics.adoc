The substation section encompasses two variants of elements. The first variant, which we will denote as process-type elements or process structure, enables the creation of the physically visible structure within the substation. This process structure is comprised of the following elements:

* https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Voltage-Level[Voltage Level]
* https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Bay[Bay]
* https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Conducting-Equipment[Conducting Equipment]
* `General Equipment` (not yet implemented)
* https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Power-Transformer[Conducting Equipment]
* `Transformer Winding` (not yet implemented)
* `Neutral Winding` (not yet implemented)
* `Line` (not yet implemented)
* `Process` (not yet implemented)

The other type of elements is referred to as function-type elements or functional structure, and it includes the following elements:
